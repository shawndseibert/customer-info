# Email Integration Setup Guide

## The Problem
With localStorage-only storage, customer submissions on their devices don't automatically reach your computer. Here are the solutions:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Solution: Email Integration**

### How It Works:
1. Customer submits form on their phone
2. **Automatic email sent to you** with all their information
3. You receive instant notification of new leads
4. You can manually add them to your admin system

### Setup Steps:

#### 1. Sign Up for EmailJS (Free)
- Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- Create free account (500 emails/month free)
- Verify your email address

#### 2. Create Email Service
- Dashboard â†’ Email Services â†’ Add New Service
- Choose "Gmail" (or your email provider)
- Connect your email account
- Note the **Service ID** (e.g., `service_xyz123`)

#### 3. Create Email Template
- Dashboard â†’ Email Templates â†’ Create New Template
- Template Name: "New Customer Quote Request"
- Subject: `New Quote Request from {{customer_name}}`
- Email Body Template:
```
New customer quote request received!

```
- Note the **Template ID** (e.g., `template_abc456`)

#### 4. Get Public Key
- Dashboard â†’ Account â†’ General
- Copy your **Public Key** (e.g., `user_def789`)

#### 5. Update Your Code
In `customer-script.js`, replace these lines:
```javascript
// Replace these with your actual EmailJS credentials:
await emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams, 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
```

With your actual IDs:
```javascript
await emailjs.send('service_xyz123', 'template_abc456', templateParams, 'user_def789');
```

### ðŸ“§ **What You'll Receive**
Every time a customer submits the form, you'll get an email like:

```

## ðŸ”„ **Alternative Solutions**

### Option 2: Google Sheets Integration
- Use Google Apps Script to save submissions to a Google Sheet
- You can access the sheet from any device
- More complex setup but gives you a database-like view

### Option 3: Shared Link System
- Generate a unique code for each submission
- Customer gets a link they can share with you
- You can view their submission via the link
- Simpler but requires customer to share the link

### Option 4: QR Code with Pre-filled Admin Form
- QR code links to admin form with customer fields pre-populated
- Customer fills out form on your device during visit
- Data goes directly to your admin system
- Good for in-person consultations

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Workflow with Email**

1. **Setup EmailJS** (one-time, 15 minutes)
2. **Customer submits form** â†’ You get instant email
3. **Read email** â†’ Get all customer details
4. **Open admin system** â†’ Manually add customer (copy from email)
5. **Follow up** within 24 hours

### Benefits:
- âœ… **Instant notifications** - know immediately when someone requests a quote
- âœ… **All information preserved** - nothing gets lost
- âœ… **Works on any device** - emails sync everywhere
- âœ… **Professional** - automated responses maintain your brand
- âœ… **Free** - EmailJS free tier handles hundreds of submissions

### Limitations:
- Requires manual entry into admin system (but email has all the info)
- Depends on email service (but very reliable)

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start**

**If you want to get started immediately:**
1. Set up EmailJS (15 minutes)
2. Update the three IDs in customer-script.js
3. Test with a form submission
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Result:** Every customer submission will email you instantly with all their information, and you can manually add them to your admin system when convenient.
